\begin{abstract}
When Engine Yard started trying to reliably automate our infrastructure, it
quickly became clear that comprehensive tools did not exist to seamlessly
configure and control systems of our scale.  Vertebra is our attempt at
addressing a number of these difficult issues in a flexible way.  This document
specifies Vertebra's use cases, core concepts, protocols, and components.  Some
consideration to implementation details is also given.
